## Development Background

In todayâ€™s self-study-driven educational environment, it is crucial for every student to have access to quality resources and peer support. As a senior high school student who has been self-taught in programming since primary school, I have personally experienced the challenges associated with this. While there are numerous online communities for students to exchange ideas, many of them lack file-sharing capabilities, which is highly inconvenient. Additionally, large online communities with thousands of members make it difficult to ensure the legality and appropriateness of content. These issues inspired me to develop **Knowledge Share**.

## Expected Goal

**Knowledge Share** is designed to bridge the gap between students and the valuable resources they need to succeed. My goal is to create a platform where students can freely exchange educational materials, ask questions, and support each other in their academic journals.

**Knowledge Share** is not intended to be a massive platform serving thousands of users simultaneously. Instead, it is a tailored website system designed to function within individual schools or even specific classes. Students within the same school receive similar education, facilitating more effective communication and ensuring that shared resources are relevant and accurate. Moreover, teachers can utilize **Knowledge Share** to distribute materials and assignments.

## Key Features

Below are the key features of **Knowledge Share**:

- **Forum System**: Create, manage, and edit posts and comments, facilitating interactive discussions.
- **User System**: Includes personalized settings for a customized user experience.
- **File System**: Provides file storage, upload, and download capabilities for easy resource sharing.
- **User-Friendly Administration System**: Simplifies management tasks for administrators, ensuring smooth operation.
