## Development Environment

### Operating System

Most work related to this project was done on a **Windows10** computer, with WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) support.

The documnets was wrote on a **Kali Linux** laptop.

### Editor

| Name        | Usage                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PyCharm** | Used for developing and managing the entire project.         |
| **Typora**  | Used for writing and formatting documentation.               |
| **Vim**     | Used for quick file editing in the terminal during server configuration. |

### Version Control

Uses **Git** for version control.

### Extra Tools

Uses **PuTTY** for server connections.

## Database

Although Django supports a wide range of SQL databases, I use the default SQL database: SQLite. Here are the reasons:

- The website is not designed for large-scale operations, so performance is not a critical concern.
- SQLite facilitates quick deployment.
- SQLite requires minimal setup, allowing the website to run smoothly even on a low-cost server.

## The Usage of ChatGPT

During the development of this project, I used ChatGPT as a technical assistant. When I encountered problems, I preferred to search on Google first because reading blogs is often a faster way to find solutions and learn new concepts. If I couldn't find a solution, I turned to ChatGPT for help. Instead of simply copying the code, I asked for explanations and then retyped the code myself, ensuring that I learned from the entire process.
