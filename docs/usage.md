## Overview

![Home Page](/usage.assets/image-20240814152919280.png)

This is the home page of Knowledge Share. When users visit it for the first time, an introduction will be shown, giving users a brief overview of the website.

![Boards](/usage.assets/image-20240814153247442.png)

Knowledge Share is structured into various Boards, each curated by the site administrator. These boards correspond to different subjects or functionalities, such as the `Physics` board for physics-related discussions and the `File Share` board for file exchanges.

![Topics](/usage.assets/image-20240814153552867.png)

Within each board, users can create Topics after registering on the site. These topics serve as discussion hubs for resource sharing, idea exchange, and problem-solving, inviting all members to engage actively.

![Posts](/usage.assets/image-20240814153609465.png)

By selecting a topic, users can view all related Posts. This feature allows you to download resources shared by others or contribute your own materials, fostering a community-driven knowledge repository.

> Unfortunately, the `Forgot your password` feature is not available at this time. Although Knowledge Share has a fully functional password recovery system (tested in the terminal), due to restrictions imposed by China's Internet regulations, I am unable to provide this service as a senior high school student.

## FAQ

### Why does the address look unusual?

The reason this address appears unconventional is due to the cost associated with purchasing a domain like `www.knowledgeshare.com`, which is currently beyond my budget.

### Why is the website marked as `Not secure`?

This issue is similar to the previous one. The reason the website is marked as `Not secure` is that obtaining a security certificate (to make the site appear as `https://`) requires a financial investment.

I assure you that visiting this site will not put your computer at risk. I simply don't have the expertise to execute any malicious activities, even if I wanted to try.
